# 🔐 File Packer & Unpacker with Encryption

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a Java-based file utility tool that provides functionality for packing multiple files into a single archive and unpacking them back with all metadata preserved.  
To enhance security, the packed file is encrypted, and only authorized users can decrypt & extract the data.  
The project also features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction.
