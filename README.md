# File Packer & Unpacker with Encryption #

# Project Overview 

This project is a Java-based file utility tool that provides functionality for packing multiple files into a single archive and unpacking them back with all metadata preserved. 
To enhance security, the packed file is encrypted, and only authorized users can decrypt & extract the data. 
The project also features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user-friendly interaction. 

# Key Features
# File Packing 
1.Combines multiple regular files into a single archive file. 
2.Stores metadata (file name, size, timestamp) along with file content. 

# File Unpacking 
1. Extracts individual files from the packed archive. 
2. Restores all original metadata and file structure.
   
# Data Security 
1. Built-in encryption and decryption to protect packed files. 

# Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
1. User-friendly GUI built in Java (Swing). 
2. Provides simple options for selecting files, encrypting, packing, and unpacking. 

# Cross-platform 
1. Runs seamlessly on any system with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

# Learning Outcomes 
> Practical experience with Java I/O Streams and File Handling APIs. 
> Implementation of metadata management during file operations. 
> Strong understanding of encryption/decryption techniques in Java. 
> Hands-on experience with GUI development (Swing). 
> Insight into archiving and compression utilities (similar to ZIP/TAR).
